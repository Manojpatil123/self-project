concerning the nature of any interim status refering to the wb and gaza the palestinians implemented by negotiations it\\nstates that    \\n   israel will remain the existing source of authority until final status\\n    is agreed upon\\n   israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the \\n    interim selfgovernment arrangements isga\\n   the isga will apply to the palestinian inhabitants of the territories\\n    under israeli military administration the arrangements will not have a \\n    territorial application nor will they apply to the israeli population \\n    of the territories or to the palestinian inhabitants of jerusalem\\n   residual powers not delegated under the isga will be reserved by israel\\n   israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd\\n   israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects\\n    external internal and for the maintenance of public order\\n   the organs of the isga will be of an administrativefunctional nature\\n   the exercise of powers under the isga will be subject to cooperation and \\n    coordination with israel \\n   israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the \\n    areas of administration justice personnel agriculture education\\n    business tourism labor and social welfare local police\\n    local transportation and communications municipal affairs and religious\\n    affairs\\n\\nthe palestinian counterproposal of march 1992\\n   the establishment of a palestinian interim selfgoverning authority \\n    pisga whose authority is vested by the palestinian people\\n   its pisga powers cannot be delegated by israel\\n   in the interim phase the israeli military government and civil adminis\\n    tration will be abolished and the pisga will asume the powers previous\\n    ly enjoyed by israel\\n   there will be no limitations on its pisga powers and responsibilities \\n    except those which derive from its character as an interim arrangement\\n   by the time pisga is inaugurated the israeli armed forces will have \\n    completed their withdrawal to agreed points along the borders of the \\n    occupied palestinian territory opt the opt includes jerusalem\\n   the jurisdiction of the pisga shall extend to all of the opt including \\n    its land water and air space\\n   the pisga shall have legislative powers to enact amend and abrogate laws\\n   it will wield executive power withput foreign control\\n   it shall determine the nature of its cooperation with any state or \\n    international body and shall be empowered to conclude binding coopera\\n    tive agreements free of any control by israel\\n   the pisga shall administer justice throughout the opt and will have sole\\n    and exclusive jruisdiction\\n   it will have a strong police force responsible for security and public\\n    order in the opt\\n   it can request the assistance of a un peacekeeping force\\n   disputes with israel over selfgoverning arrangements will be settled by \\n    a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of\\n    the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga \\n    jordan egypt syria and israel\\n\\nbut perhaps the bargaining attitude behind these very different visions\\nof the interim stage is wrong for two reasons 1 the present palestinian \\nand israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years\\nso the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period 2 since\\nthese negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the \\nconflict attention to issues dealing with a desired final status are mis\\nplaced and potentially destructive\\n\\ngiven this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper\\ntheir maximalist approaches as stated above how can israeli worries and \\ndesire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very \\nreal interim palestinian selfgoverning entity\\n\\ntim\\n                                                       \\napril 13 1993 response by al moore l629159lmsc5islmsclockheedcom\\n\\nbasically the problem is that israel may remain or leave the occupied \\nterritories it cannot do both it cannot do neither so far israe \\ncontinues to propose that they remain the palestinians propose that they \\nleave why should either change their view it is worth pointing out that \\nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\\nreduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction\\nand in fact may be said to not be negotiating\\n\\n\\ntim \\n\\nthere seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed the\\nfirst is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so\\nthere is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in \\nexchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc the second\\nis that of the arab worldpalestinians where there is the demand that\\nthese tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving\\nanything tangible back  given this the gap between the two stances\\nseems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns\\nfor its expected concessions by tangible is meant something that\\n1 provides israel with comparable protection from the land it is to \\ngive up 2 in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine \\nwill be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically \\nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens \\nor visitors\\n\\nin essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian\\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel\\nwas assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to \\ncoexisting with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel \\nfrom its territory\\n\\taside from some of the rather slanted proposals above\\n\\thow could such guarantees be instilled for example\\n\\thow could such guaranteescontrols be added to the\\n\\tpalestinian pisga proposals\\n\\nisrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\\nit lets go gives lands back to arab states no more buffer zone gives\\nfull autonomy to palestinians any andor all of the arab parties\\ncould and would if not controlled somehow easily return to the \\ntraditional antiisrael position the question then is how to really\\nensure that that will not happen\\n\\ntim\\n\\n', 'from

probabilities\\nthese results as applied to the 198 season were reported in one of the\\nbill james baseball abstract books 1987  help me out here somebody\\n\\nfor example a situation might be inning 3 score 20 runner on second\\nand no outs  there were 4212 regular season major league games last\\nyear  with the rockies and marlins there will be more this year\\nsay this situation came up in 100 of those and the team ahead won\\n75 of them  then the value of this situation is 075\\n\\ndescription of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat\\n plus any baserunning and creditdebit the player by that amount each time\\n he gets a plate appearance\\n\\nnow for each player sum up all his atbat and baserunning values\\nfor the season to obtain an overall value for that player  obviously\\nthe sum of all players values for each game and for the season as a\\nwhole will be 0\\n\\nthats only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher\\ntheres no validation involved\\n\\nok theres a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on youre\\nadding probabilities and probabilities dont add  runs you can add the\\ntotal team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many\\nruns fred contributed etc  but probabilities dont work that way  if bob\\nincreases his teams chance of winning by 1 in each of 400 pas that does\\nnot mean that bob increased his teams chance of winning by 400  in fact\\nit doesnt mean anything because the units are screwy\\n\\ni agree and disagree  john is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses  while you are probably correct that 400\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses it means something  i would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1 in\\neach of 400 pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby 5 in each of 400 pas  thus there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between johns statistic and winning games  thus\\nbefore you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is\\n\\nconsider an example  bob hits a 2out solo hr in the bottom of the first\\nabout 12 on your scale  he does the same thing again in the fourth with\\nthe score tied for another 14  and again in the seventh with the score\\ntied for another 22  and finally in the ninth to win the game by a score\\nof 76 for a value of 05  bob hit 4 solo hr in 4 plate appearances and\\nwas credited by your method with 12  14  22  5  98  but what does\\nthat mean  was bob 98 responsible for the win  certainly not the defense\\nis always 50 responsible if you include pitching in that and bob wasnt\\npitching  in fact bob was only 47 of the offense which is a lot but not\\neven close to 100  furthermore what about the other 3 team runs  say\\nthey all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game\\nwhich are just as valuable as hr to take the lead see lindsey and fred will\\nhimself have accrued a good 4 rating or so  so fred and bob combined have\\namassed 138 of a win in one game  theres clearly a problem here\\n\\nthe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has  first we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game  second remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning  that is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases\\nthus im not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game  sometimes\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime less than one  also\\nthe pitchers bad performances giving up 6 runs may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game  also any batter that\\npulled an 04 night would give large negatives  \\n\\n\\n\\ngreg thinking about the right things but his intuition is off the\\nmark  closers are enormously important  the total number of runs\\nvalue is outweighed by when they come or are prevented from comming\\nthe doubling which greg allows is not enough\\n\\nin another article i proposed a test of this  we can predict a teams \\nwonlost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they\\nscore and allow without regard to when those runs score in the game  if\\nlate runs are really more important than early runs then looking only at\\nlate runs should lead to a better predictor right\\n\\nno but really only because you have a smaller sample size  i would\\nthink however that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning  and realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation not a blow out  it is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning  look a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games  on the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win  the\\noffence has many more outs to do something about  but i am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either  if\\ni am down 8 runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth       \\n\\nheres another thought experiment apply this method to basketball  what\\nyou find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost\\nexactly no value because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play\\nfurthermore the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\nno time on the clock gets a 10 for the game while the star forward who \\nscored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero\\n\\ndoes this make sense\\n\\n\\nno but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made  look\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball  and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers\\nfouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team\\nwould win\\n \\nfrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda\\nat first look this statistic valadates clutchness  but it really\\ndoes not  cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down  ive never seen convincing proof that this really happens\\nso if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance  there is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness  certainly we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example  we may find for\\ninstance that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5\\ni bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses\\n\\nhow do we evaluate relief pitchers  say john and sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics runs earned runs ks bbs\\netc  both had exceptional numbers  john however only pitched\\nin closer situations while sam was a mop up man  who was more\\nvaluble to their team  probably john  who was the better \\npitcher  they were probably about the same\\n\\n

questionable\\naccuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before  thus any claimed\\ntruth in it is of questionable legitimacy  this isnt to say that the\\nbible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted\\n\\nmany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate\\n\\nnote that this feeling tends to extend to other books\\n\\nit is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion\\n\\n\\n\\nsubject pascals wager\\n\\ntypical posting\\n\\nif you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing \\nbut if you dont believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to\\nhell therefore it is foolish to be an atheist\\n\\nresponse\\n\\nthis argument is known as pascals wager  it has several flaws\\n\\nfirstly it does not indicate which religion to follow  indeed there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there  this is often\\ndescribed as the avoiding the wrong hell problem  if a person is a\\nfollower of religion x he may end up in religion ys version of hell\\n\\nsecondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be\\nincorrect you have lost nothing is not true  suppose youre believing in\\nthe wrong god  the true god might punish you for your foolishness\\nconsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer\\n\\nanother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely  or at least that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood  if in fact the possibility of there being a god \\nis close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive  so sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already\\n\\nalso many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on \\nevidence with some amount of intuition  it is not a matter of will or \\ncostbenefit analysis\\n\\nformally speaking the argument consists of four statements\\n\\n  1 one does not know whether god exists\\n  2 not believing in god is bad for ones eternal soul if god does\\n     exist\\n  3 believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist\\n  4 therefore it is in ones interest to believe in god\\n\\nthere are two approaches to the argument  the first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption and 2 as a consequence of it  one problem with this approach in\\nthe abstract is that it creates information from no information  this is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory  statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about god  but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about god  this violates\\ninformation entropy  information has been extracted from no information at\\nno cost\\n\\nthe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions  the\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nchristian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the\\nargument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your interests\\nto believe in god  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed\\n\\nthe biggest reason why pascals wager is a failure is that if god is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager  he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him\\n\\n\\n\\nsubject what is occams razor\\n\\ntypical posting\\n\\npeople keep talking about occams razor  what is it\\n\\nresponse\\n\\nwilliam of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occams \\nrazor  in its original form it said do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily  that is if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity then do so\\n\\nnowadays when people refer to occams razor they generally express it \\nmore generally for example as take the simplest solution\\n\\nthe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us\\n\\n1 there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes\\n\\n2 there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and \\nthere is also a god who created the universe  clearly this god must be \\nof nonzero complexity\\n\\ngiven that both explanations fit the facts occams razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two  solution number one\\nunfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution\\n\\n3 there isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there  \\nwe just imagine that there is\\n\\nthis third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people \\nfind unacceptable\\n

universe \\nthis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the\\nchristian god  used this way it is out of context it refers to einsteins\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory furthermore\\neinsteins religious background was jewish rather than christian\\n\\na better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following\\ni believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings\\n\\neinstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer  he believed that\\nqm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations  so far no such better theory has been found\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be\\n\\na longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion a\\nsymposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religion\\nin their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york 1941  in\\nit he says\\n\\n  the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature  for him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events  to be sure the doctrine of a\\n   personal god interfering with natural events could never be\\n   refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot\\n\\n   but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal  for a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress  in their struggle for the ethical good teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests  in their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity\\n   itself  this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task\\n\\neinstein has also said\\n\\n  it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated  i do not believe in a\\n   personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly\\n   if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it\\n\\nthe latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen \\ndukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press  \\nalso from the same book\\n\\n  i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it\\n\\nof course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that christianity is false\\n\\n\\n\\nsubject everyone

cause\\n\\ntypical posting\\n\\nsets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause\\n\\nresponse\\n\\nthe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has\\nno smallest member\\n\\nfurther even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion\\n\\n\\n\\nsubject the universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\ntypical posting\\n\\nthe presence of design in the universe proves there is a god  surely you\\ndont think all this appeared here just by chance\\n\\nresponse\\n\\nthis is known as the argument from design\\n\\nit is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talkorigins for a while\\n\\nthere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here\\nhowever the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nsocalled scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidence\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth\\n\\nthe origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it cant have come about by chance that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately\\n\\nbut if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely  the approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist\\nposition\\n\\nthis leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe\\nwhat created the creator but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability  the only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just is or was\\n\\nfrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust is without introducing a creator  indeed stephen hawking in his book\\na brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent with no beginning or end\\n\\nthe argument from design is often stated by analogy in the socalled \\nwatchmaker argument  one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach  does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it\\nevolved naturally  of course one assumes a watchmaker  yet like the \\nwatch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the \\nuniverse too must have a creator\\n\\nthe watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above \\nthose common to all arguments by design  firstly a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from preexisting materials whereas god is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing  these two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak\\n\\nsecondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in \\nthe world  if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor we wouldnt assume it was created by the watchmaker  the argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation\\n\\nfinally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature  yet in the second part of the \\nargument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom but shows elements of order  the watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent\\n\\n\\n\\nsubject independent evidence that the bible is true\\n\\ntypical

godels incompleteness theorem\\n\\ntypical posting\\n\\ngodels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nbible to be both true and complete\\n\\nresponse\\n\\ngodels first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid true or false within that formal system  technically\\nspeaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem\\n\\nessentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar \\nparadox  the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this \\nsentence is false  note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable\\n\\nthe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims\\nthat godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation\\n\\none can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom \\nthis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however\\n\\nit may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with  it may then be possible to show\\nthat godels incompleteness theorem holds for that system  however that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists\\nwithin the system  furthermore it certainly wouldnt tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally\\n\\nnote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractions\\n\\nanother frequent claim is that godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable religious texts are not formal\\nsystems so such claims are nonsense\\n\\n\\n\\nsubject george bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\ntypical posting\\n\\ndid george bush really say that

edition of the\\ncommercial space newsspace technology investor to summarize\\n  \\nspace advertising\\n    first advertising on space vehicles is not new  it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organizations logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle  for example the latest gps launcher had the\\nvery prominent logos on its side of\\n    mcdonnell douglas the delta launcher\\n    rockwell international who built the gps satellite\\n    usaf who paid for the satellite and launch and\\n    the gpsnavstar program office\\n   this has not been considered paid advertising but rather\\npublic relations since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside and there was no money exchanged for this  however putting\\na 10 high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis advertising as much as it is public relations in my\\nopinion  and by the way i note that the dcx test vehicle has\\nrather prominent mcdonnelldouglas and sdio logos on the side\\n   there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit  on the shuttle for example i know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload\\nbay  these ventures would be different than public relations in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization  for\\nexample painting the et to look like a pepsi can or putting a\\ndisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it\\n  \\nadverts on launch vehicles\\n   the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about\\n1990 when several noninvolved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a proton launch  an italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers i remember  similarly\\nsoviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nolympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations  mars candy bars for\\nexample got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nbritish visiting cosmonaut to mir\\n   now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles  the upcoming conestoga launch in june putting the comet\\nrecoverable payload

this advertising display was published in\\nspace news magazine a couple of months ago\\n   as a side note robert lorsch an advertising executive is\\ntalking about suing nasa  he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program  lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming comet nasa violated an agreement that it would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and\\nreceiving compensation

enhanced mail pem using\\n the cryptographic techniques of rsa and des  it allows your\\n electronic mail to have the properties of authentication ie who\\n sent it can be confirmed and privacy ie nobody can read it except\\n the intended recipient\\n\\n ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrrscss3clmsuedu\\n most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routines\\n which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc\\n\\n2  how can i get ripem\\n\\n ripem contains the library of cryptographic routines rsaref which is\\n considered munitions and thus is exportrestricted from distribution\\n to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the us or\\n canada  therefore the following request is quoted from the readme\\n file\\n\\n please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution\\n outside of the usa or canada  this is a personal request from me\\n the author of ripem and a condition of your use of ripem\\n\\n note that rsaref is not in the public domain and a license for it is\\n included with the distribution  you should read it before using\\n ripem\\n\\n the best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy since this will\\n reduce the load on those sites that do carry it not to mention the\\n humans that run them  naturally this requires that you trust the\\n friend\\n\\n ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents\\n in the us from rsacom cd to rsaref and read the readme file for\\n info  last i looked this site contains only the source tree and\\n does not contain compiled binaries or the nice mac version\\n\\n ripem as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on\\n rpubclmsuedu which is open to nonanonymous ftp for users in the\\n us and canada who are citizens or permanent residents  to find out\\n how to obtain access ftp there cd to pubcrypt and read the file\\n getting_access  for convenience binaries for many architectures are\\n available here in addition to the full source tree\\n\\n3  will ripem run on my machine\\n\\n probably  it has already been ported to msdos and most flavors of\\n unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc  ports to\\n macintosh include a standard unixstyle port and a rather nice\\n maclike port written by raymond lau author of stuffit  more ports\\n are expected and help of users is invited\\n\\n4  will ripem work with my mailer\\n\\n probably  how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend\\n on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though  the users\\n guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use ripem\\n with many popular mailers including berkeley mush elm and mh\\n code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu\\n emacs\\n\\n if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one\\n in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure\\n and may be useful to others feel free to post it to altsecurityripem\\n\\n5  what is rsa\\n\\n rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric or publickey  this means\\n that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to\\n decrypt  because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other\\n you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your\\n decryption or private key to yourself  anyone can use your public\\n key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to\\n decrypt it  note that the message sent with rsa is normally just\\n the des key to the real message see what is des\\n\\n note that the above only provides for privacy  for authentication\\n the fingerprint of the message see what is a fingerprint like\\n md5 is encrypted with the senders private key  the recipient can\\n use the senders public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message\\n must have come from the sender\\n\\n rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who\\n invented it  to find out more about rsa ftp to rsacom and look in\\n pubfaq or look in scicrypt\\n\\n6  what is des\\n\\n des is the data encryption standard a widely used symmetric or\\n secretkey crypto system  unlike rsa des uses the same key to\\n encrypt and decrypt messages  however des is much faster than rsa\\n\\n ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts\\n your mail with des using that key  it then encrypts that key with the\\n recipients public rsa key and includes the result in the letter\\n allowing the recipient to recover the des key\\n\\n des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a\\n key length considered too short by modern standards  however it\\n should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large\\n corporation or government agency  it is not unlikely that future\\n ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by using\\n multiple encryption with des\\n\\n7  what is pem and how does ripem relate\\n\\n pem is privacy enhanced mail a system for allowing easy transfer of\\n encrypted electronic mail  it is described in rfcs 14211424 these\\n documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs 11131115\\n\\n ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem\\n specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not\\n handle at this time  their addition is planned\\n\\n8  whats this about distributing and authenticating keys\\n\\n for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know\\n your public key  for you to be able to confirm that the message\\n received came from her you must know her public key  it is important\\n that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that\\n his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read\\n\\n ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server\\n the distributed finger servers and a flat file  all three are\\n described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution\\n none of them provide perfect security\\n\\n9  why do all ripem public keys look very similar\\n\\n ripem public keys begin with a pkcs identifier describing various\\n characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in\\n your key may be the same as those of lots of other peoples keys\\n this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the\\n same class of key were generated with the same program are of the\\n same length etc\\n\\n10  what is a fingerprint like md5\\n\\n md5 is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc\\n it provides a 128bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash\\n of the plaintext  it is cryptographically secure because it is not\\n possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a\\n different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint  thus\\n instead of signing the entire message with the senders private key\\n only the md5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication\\n\\n md5 is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often\\n used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data as a\\n passphrase interpreter or cookie generator\\n\\n md5 is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in\\n rfc 1321\\n\\n11  what is pgp\\n\\n pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy\\n pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently\\n pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa\\n\\n some major differences between pgp and ripem\\n\\n  pgp has more key management features particularly for users without\\n   a direct network connection\\n\\n  ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of\\n   working with other pem software  pgp makes no attempt to be compatible\\n   with anything other than pgp in fact pgp 10 is not compatible with\\n   pgp 20\\n\\n  ripem uses rsaref a library of rsa routines from rsa data security\\n   inc  rsaref comes with a license which allows noncommercial use\\n   pgp uses its own implementation of rsa which is not licensed thus\\n   pkp the firm holding the us patents on the rsa algorithm claims\\n   that it is a infringement of that patent to make use or sell pgp in\\n   the us or canada  in acknowledgement of this pgps original\\n   author phil zimmermann says in the documentation\\n\\n   in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency \\n   you shouldnt actually run pgp on your computer because public\\n   key partners wants to forbid you from running my software  pgp is\\n   contraband  \\n\\n  both pgp and ripem are exportrestricted and cannot be sent outside\\n   the us and canada  however pgp already exists on many ftp sites\\n   in europe and other places\\n\\n whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is\\n recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues\\n\\n note that the above facts both regarding patent and export\\n restrictions are somewhat controversial many people think it\\n shouldnt be that way and some people interpret various documents\\n differently  unfortunately discussions of it on the net inevitably\\n seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in\\n misclegalcomputing  see  disclaimer\\n\\n12  what about rpem\\n\\n rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail  it was similar to ripem\\n but used a publickey cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in\\n an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa  it was written by mark\\n riordan the same author as ripem\\n\\n its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many\\n including rabin public key partners pkp claimed that their patent\\n was broad enough to cover any publickey cipher whose strength rested\\n in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes not just rsa\\n this claim is not universally accepted by any means but was not\\n challenged for pragmatic reasons\\n\\n rpem is not really used anymore  it is not compatible with ripem or pgp\\n\\n13  what is mime\\n\\n mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and is\\n described in rfc 1341  you can find out about it in the newsgroup\\n compmailmime  how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely\\n clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type\\n applicationxripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones  i\\n hope some standards will emerge  draft internet documents exist on\\n the matter\\n\\n14  i have this simple way to defeat the

asked us whether we\\nshould think of the serbs as doing gods work in bosnia  ive\\nrefrained from posting in hope that someone who is more familiar with\\nthe ot than i would answer  but at this point i feel i have to say\\nsomething\\n\\nmany things about this posting bother me  i know of not the slightest\\nsuggestion in the nt that christians should use force to propagate the\\ngospel and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\\nof moslems violates the heart of the gospel  christ died to break\\ndown these distinctions  in him there is neither jew nor greek there\\nis neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female  if\\nmoslems do not know him we may preach to them but we dont kill\\nthem  furthermore the attack is between states not religions\\nthere are christians being attacked as well  one of the towns under\\nattack is one of the few places where christians and moslems are\\nliving together peacefully\\n\\nthe precedents being suggested are from the ot  there are in fact two\\ndifferent things being alluded to  the first is from the entry into\\ncanaan  for that to be a parallel we would need for god to have\\npromised this land through a prophet  and we would need the war to be\\na holy war  there were tight constraints on behavior in those\\nattacks  any violations were likely to cause the israelites to be\\ndefeated  rape would not have been tolerated  while the accounts in\\njoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed note that it was\\npossible for a town to make peace with the israelites and that once\\nthat was done  even when deception was involved  they were\\nexpected to honor it  in contrast there have been many violations of\\nagreement in this incident i see no evidence that god has granted\\nbosnia to the serbs as a promised land and if he had their behavior\\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war\\n\\nthe other ot parallel is from later when israel was defeated by\\nassyria and babylonia  the prophets saw this as a judgement on israel\\nfor her sins  someone asks whether we shouldnt see this as a\\njudgement on the bosnians for their sins  this sounds like a replay\\nof the old claim that we shouldnt have doctors or hospitals because\\nillness is gods judgement  yes even bad things may be used by god\\nfor good  that includes actions of bad people  but that doesnt\\njustify them  if you read the prophets you find them very clear that\\nin attacking israel the assyrians and babylonians were acting as\\nunintentional agents of god  their intent was to attack gods\\npeople and they would be judged for it  the fact that they were\\nactually carrying out gods plan didnt excuse their action\\nfurthermore we shouldnt conclude from this that all attacks are\\njudgements from god  god explicitly interpreted that case through\\nhis prophets  as far as i know he did not send any prophets to\\nbosnia  while i find it hard to see any good in the current fighting\\ni am sure god will eventually make good come out of bad  but that\\ndoesnt justify it and it wont save the people who are doing it from\\njudgement\\n\\ni am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue\\nbecause of current tensions between the west and moslemoriented\\nnations  what we do not need is for moslems to conclude that\\nchristians think its ok to kill moslems  the implications for the\\nmideast and even relations with american moslems could be quite\\nserious\\n', 'from ignatzchinetchiilus dave ihnat\\nsubject re once tapped your code is no good any more\\nsummary but for all

have all hurt god with our sin\\n\\npaul conditt reveals his feelings\\nin case you couldnt tell i get extremely angry and upset when\\ni see things like this  instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias we need to be reaching out to people with aids and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases  whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant  they still need jesus\\n\\nthe first issue you bring up is your anger  it is obviously wrong to\\nbe angry gal 51920 for any reason especially extremely angry\\nwhich is on par with hatred  jesus has every reason to be angry at us\\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin yet his prayer was forgive\\nthem father they know not what they do  knowing how forgiving jesus\\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\\nlove for him  please dont give in to anger it will only cause\\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings\\n\\nits okay if you read something that bothers you but you need to\\naddress it in a loving way  if right now i felt like someone out\\nthere was saying that god punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\\naids because they deserve punishment that others dont then i would\\nframe a response something like this\\n\\nit makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that aids which is\\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other is gods punishment\\nfor people who have committed certain sins  god loves all of his\\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him  we\\nwill all be judged after we die but until then we all have the\\nopportunity to accept gods grace by earnestly seeking after him with\\nall of our hearts believing the gospels testimony repenting of our\\nsin confessing that jesus is lord at baptism and living a new life\\nfor him\\n let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned  gods arm is not\\nto short to save  he will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\\nor a misled person  he works for the good of all men  even through\\nthe worst of situations he has set the times and places for all men\\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him\\n\\nthe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\\nof people with aids  fortunately what you describe as seeing is\\nactually misperceiving  you have been missing the points made in the\\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that havent been\\nexpressed  i know that its sometimes hard to discount your\\nperceptions but please try to be openminded\\n\\nyou are quite correct in

third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\\ncontracted aids  how someone gets aids is only relevant to their\\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved\\n\\nthe important point to be made however is that not listening to gods\\ncommands or advice or warnings ie sinning causes harm or\\nmisfortune to yourself and others  for this reason a good way to\\nprevent

121\\n\\n\\nive been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest ive \\ntranscribed some of my notes below  since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible please assume that all factual errors are mine  permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction\\n\\nmichael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois\\nacdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and\\ninternational security  rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using russian launchers and satellites  i think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the international relations program\\n\\nthe concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson  went to tonga\\nto visit a friend  while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king\\nwho happened to be a big tv fan  matt bought the king a satellite dish which \\nthe king thought was really nifty  since tonga has a gnp of about 70 million\\nhis majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this  matt thought\\nthere probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots  while this isnt entirely off the wall it was very unusual\\nseeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 is a lot of\\nslots\\n\\nthe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl\\nhilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions\\nsupporting tongas case  eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots ranging from \\n70 e to 170 e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside\\naccording to sternberg four of these from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and \\nthe pacific rim \\n\\nrimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax\\nhaven  they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately 2 billion  its not easy to raise that kind of money\\neventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware  they began \\nnegotiating with glavkosmos for hardware  mr sternberg describes operating in \\nmoscow in such harsh terms that i dont think ill visit there for a long time\\nbesides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate  for example everybody can sell you everything  \\neveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by\\n\\neventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof 150 million  however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup  sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures  since glavkosmos was\\nout of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities  he\\nagain described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms  eventually\\nhe worked out a deal and on dec 4 1992 he met with koptev who heads the \\nrussian space program to sign the deal  koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat\\n\\nthe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied \\nmechanics  npo pm to use their acronym  this organization is located in \\nsiberia cant figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age  sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from musovites  they are hard workers honest\\npeople who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners  at this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners \\n\\nsternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm  his company is \\napparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partnersit apparently costs the russians about 4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for 50 million in the west  if you want to give them \\nspecifications theyll build you a satellite  for the particular satellites\\nthat rimsat will be using costs run about 378000 per transponder year  this\\ncompares to 810000 ty in the us  they can sell their time for about 11\\nmillion compared to 26 million in the us  rimsat will launch their \\nsatellites on protons  to get the best prices they bought in bulk  they \\nhave the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give\\nyou their address  the first launch is scheduled for october and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place\\nnow\\n\\ntidbits\\n\\n  sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there except\\nthat we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier\\n\\n  russian launches are self insured  the promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months\\n\\n  major investors in rimsat include russell 2020 which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in us aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off\\n\\n  he downplayed the instabilites in the exussr saying that we are worried\\npartly because we arent used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith  italy gets a new government every two weeks but we dont worry \\nbecause were used to it  he predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in russia we wont worry about their stability as much\\n\\n  part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney  the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting\\n25 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in \\nrubles  to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian\\nbank account  npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government\\n\\n  one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry  however intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites which was rather reassuring\\n\\n  the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime  the older gorizont horizon satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years while the more modern express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years  while this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference  at these prices they can afford to launch new ones  in addition\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date\\nhardware\\n\\n \\njosh hopkins

dlecointgarnetacnsfsuedu darius_lecointe writes\\n\\nyou cannot show from scripture that the weekly sabbath is part of the\\nceremonial laws   before you post a text in reply investigate its context\\n\\nfirst of all ceremonial law is an extrascriptural term  it is sometimes\\nused as a framework to view scripture  but if you look at collosions\\nwithout going into it with the assumption that the sabbath cannot be \\na ceremonial law you will see that it does refer to the sabbath\\n\\npaul writes in collosions 21417 how that christ nailed the laws that were\\nagainst us to his cross and therefore we should not be judged in what\\nwhat food we eat what we drink the keeping of new moons and holy days\\nor the keeping of the sabbath\\n\\nthe word for sabbath in this verse is sabbaton and is used throughout the\\nnew testament to refer to the 7th day  if there is any scripture from\\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law this is one of them and the\\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws\\n\\nif one goes into this with the fundamental assumption the sabbath cannot\\nbe a ceremonial law then he will have to find some way around it like\\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\\n7th day because the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law  but\\npaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \\nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\\nin his writings\\n\\nalso why is the sabbath absent from the epistles except for hebrews 4 which\\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith  surely it would have\\nbeen a big problem for first century christians living in a society\\nthat did not rest on the 7th day  especially slaves many new converst were\\nslaves  it would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath\\nif it had been mandatory  why is there no mention of this in the epistles\\n\\nlink hudson\\n', 'from jamesdlss2 james

never said that murray was a bad gm  i merely said\\nthat he isnt the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor\\nif murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley

and who is to say my opinion is any better \\nthan yours or yours than mine  but the point of my original original\\npost if not well stated was that murray has the gm abilities but not\\nthe coaching abilities  which leads to below\\n\\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent\\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success\\n\\ni think at this point theres a personal emotional element involved here\\nwhich transcends murrays logical thought  as outsiders its fine for \\nus to say he should hire a different coach  in fact he has talked about\\ndoing so in the past  but the press here in detroit at least has so\\nbuilt up this business about murray never getting past the second round of\\nthe playoffs as a coach that i think he has taken it upon himself to \\nprove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second\\nround  he needs to as the papers say get that monkey off his back\\nso it becomes a matter not of intelligence but of pride  is it foolish\\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic  perhaps but were all\\na little that way from time to time  i think eventually hell step down\\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties and the team will\\nimprove as a result\\n\\ni think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\\non gm work  in that sense once he steps down as coach well see how\\ngood of a gm he really is\\n\\nbut murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm\\nso none of this is true anyway\\n\\ni may not agree with everything

and believe\\notherwise the trap is the easy way out\\n\\tfor yourself i think it would be a good idea to realize that the\\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with

whatever the factors\\nleading to that dysfunction with ethnic minorities it is more usually than\\nnot as i said socioeconomic disenfranchisement\\n\\tif for example you lived in an area where there

engaging in organized criminal activities but ask people on\\nthe street and theyll 8outof10 times tell you that black gangs and\\ncrime are what they most fear during the disturbance in los angeles

have two catchers who have demonstrated solid\\nabilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out\\nrunners  \\n\\n\\tthis is the crux of the argument to me at least  both the\\nsdcn and the nonsdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catchers\\ndefense is basically nonmeasurable at present  you can talk about how\\nimportant calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls\\nin the dirt  but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\\ncatchers rank in defense  \\n\\n\\tlooking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect\\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves\\nor the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher  as far as i\\ncan tell he doesnt have any particular problem in his mechanics\\nsuch as sasser  he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\\nthe ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\\nclear that up is playing and practice time  i cant see how repetitions\\nat aaa are any better then reps in the majors  \\n\\n\\tall were left with is the calling the game aspect  olsen  and\\nberryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\\nthe pitchering staff  but this is a reputation that is given to almost\\nall veteran catchers  how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn\\nthe major league pitching staff  the only way any catcher is going to\\nlearn tom glavines pitches is to catch tom glavine  similarly i wouldnt\\nbe supprised if the pitchers claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over\\npitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen  but \\ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with lopez\\n\\n\\tnow since lopez cant learn how to handle the major league\\npitchers while hes in aaa and since he doesnt have any glaring\\nproblem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in aaa that he\\ncant learn just as well while in the majors  \\n\\ndave\\n__________\\ndave

whereas no one has proposed\\nfederal agencies be denied f and because they could recover it themselves\\nthe correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits\\nof n in en f\\n\\nthe one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above but the\\nmutilation could be detected  a better approach would be to mutilate the\\nentire law enforcement block  if it were done with a group encryption scheme\\nsuch as des or presumably skipjack the chances the law enforcement block\\ncan be recovered are lessened\\n\\nwhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search  when digital transmission\\nbecomes widely available would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks\\n\\none way to avoid notice would be to spoof protocol information of the block\\ncontaining m as well as spoofing the law enforcement block\\n\\nthe goal is to use a secure communications scheme without redress to \\ndetection or key k interception contained encrypted within the law\\nenforcement block  the data stream is returned to its original state\\nfor use by the clipper chip or system if required for proper operation\\n\\nit is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within\\nthe clipper chip yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for\\nrequiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting\\nand decrypting em k\\n\\nthe spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols including\\non the resulting serial data stream  existing clipper products could\\nbe subborned  after all they are high security encryption systems right\\n\\nsuper enciphermentencryption could allow the chip to be used without\\nredress to detection of the use of the chip or disclosure of the serial\\nnumber  security must be adequate to deny the serial number which should\\nnot be recoverable by other means  one can see the use of cut outs for\\nprocurring clipper phones or once the number of units is high enough\\nstealing them  it would be a mistake on the part of authority but nice\\nfrom a point of privacy if the serial number n were not associated with\\na particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and \\ndistribution process  hopefully the list of known missing or stolen\\nclipper serial numbers n encrypted with f and the protocols are not \\nsufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream\\nthis could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or\\nspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted\\nstream\\n\\ndetection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned\\nscheme\\n\\n\\n\\nif you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own and use\\nthem in a codebook sustitution with your own where they point to a

a seemingly valid law enforcement\\nblock   these captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators\\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system  fending this off would require\\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission\\n\\nthe m code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext  this could be invalidated\\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper m stream\\nand the actual transmitted stream under the control of a secure key\\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints\\n\\nthe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\\ninterception  you

because of the type of safety that it has  i was\\nlooking at a glock 40sw and the sw 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the\\nsafties on the guns were very different  the saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot\\nmore safe  for lack of a better word than the one on the glock  of course\\nthis could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody  you\\nwould spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off  personally i\\nlike the glocks because they are very light and i think they look really cool\\nguess thats why they use them in so many movies but i wouldnt get one as\\nmy first semiauto because of the safety  i would prefer more training with\\na traditional semiauto ala colt 45 but of course thats just my opinion\\n\\njason\\n\\n\\tat the risk of starting the my gun is better than yours flame\\nwar i must disagree\\n\\t\\n\\tthere is no secret in handling a glock  in fact it is often\\nchosen besides its other merits because it shoots like a revolver does\\nbasically  it can limit the training time read budget  due to the\\nfact there are no external safties other than the trigger hence less\\ntraining time required \\n\\n\\tsmith  wesson among other types are chosen due to the fact taht\\nthey do have the external safties hammer dropas well as mag drop which\\nif properly used have saved many lives when mr bad snatched the gun\\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\\nwould not fire  this point had been made in many articles in various \\ngun magazines  if fact one author cant remember who staged a little\\ntest where he had a revolver and a sw on safe laying on a table and asked\\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal grab the gun and\\nshoot a target  he timed the people using each gun  the revolver times\\nwere pretty close but some of the times with the sw were in minutes or\\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey\\n\\n\\tyou dont often see colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation opening the issuing\\ncitycounty etc to lawsuits bad press etc\\n\\n\\tof course any problem can be overcome with enough training but\\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments  i\\nknow if i were a cop i would want something like a sw just for the off\\nchance of the gun getting taken away  the safety doesnt guarantee that\\nmr bad wont figure it out and shoot me but it could buy enough time\\nto draw a second gun and shoot mr bad before its too late\\n\\n\\tdont think i am too biassed here just because i have had 3 glocks\\nin my possession at one time because i have had a 45 as well  in fact\\nit was my first handgun  remember the

ic17eeumanitobaca\\norganization elect  comp engineering u of manitoba winnipeg manitobacanada\\nlines 75\\n\\n\\n       i would like to share with netters a few points i picked up from the pbs\\n    frontline program regarding irans nuclear activities aired on tuesday\\n    april 13 for the sake of brevity ill present them in some separate\\n    points\\n\\n    1 as many other western programs this program was laid on a bed of\\n    misinformation throughout the program to maximize the effect of the\\n    program on the viewer some of the misinformations were as follows\\n\\n     it was alleged that late imam khomeini objected to shahs technological\\n    advancements as antiislamic but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some iranian merchants are now selling personal computers \\n    these are the most ridiculous lies one can make about the objectives \\n    of the islamic revolution in toppling the shah and state of the technology\\n    in iran after revolution\\n\\n    iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard and nobody has seen\\n    iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by iranian chemical weapons in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians injured by iraqi chemical weapons\\n\\n     while the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117000 and even most\\n    radical counterrevolutionary groups claim that iran and iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead this program claims that iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war\\n\\n     the translation of iranian officials talks are not 100 true for\\n    example when iranian head of atomic energy says that  it hurts me to\\n    see that iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda the \\n    translator says  it hurts to see that iran is doing unfriendly \\n    research\\n\\n    2 almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by iranians were of countless dual usage while the program tries to \\n    undermine their nonmilitary uses without any reference to irans\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power\\n\\n    3 the whole program is trying to show the sharif university of \\n    technology as a nuclear research center while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of sharif u in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of irans industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts\\n\\n    4 a key point in programs justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by iaea  in their numerous visits from\\n    irans different sites they say we are not sure if the places visited\\n    by iaea are the real ones or not  or  we can not rely on iaeas\\n    reports and observation because they failed to see iraqs nuclear\\n    activities before as if they didnt know that iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons\\n\\n    5 as an extremely personal opinion the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of us senate foreign affairs\\n    william triplet in his way of talking as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge\\n\\n       i hope all iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media and i hope iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations\\n\\n\\nmohammad\\n\\n  \\n     international atomic energy agency\\n  \\n', 'from amandainterconcom amanda walker\\nsubject

may not be the worlds greatest expert on chiggers a type of\\nmite indigenous to the south but i certainly have spent a lot\\nof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years\\nsince we moved to nc  here are some observations gained from\\npainful experience\\n\\n  1 reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person\\n     some people get tiny red bites  others like me are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sorelike affairs\\n\\n  2 chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving  i swear\\n     that these things will itch for months\\n\\n  3 there is a lot of folklore about chiggers  i think most of\\n     it is fiction  i have tried to do research on the critters\\n     since they have such an effect on me  the only book i could\\n     find on the subject was a single book in uncs special\\n     collections library  i have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it\\n\\n  4 based on my experience and that of my family members the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesnt work  i recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false  i\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release  but this is speculation\\n\\n  5 the best approach is prevention  a couple of things work well\\n     a good insect repellent deet such as deep woods off liberally\\n     applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start  there is\\n     another preparation called chig away that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally was\\n     prepared for the army and is not commercially available  in\\n     the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get\\n     up on weekends since i literally cant go outside where we\\n     live in the country without serious consequences  they\\n     apparently dont like sulfur much at all  you can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them\\n\\n  6 no amount of prevention will be completely successful  forget\\n     the fingernail polish  i have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocaine\\n     relieves the itch  i wont tell you all the things ive tried\\n     nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned i also think\\n     it gains nothing\\n\\n  7 the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well\\n\\ndoctors seem not to care much about chiggers  the urban and suburban\\ndoctors apparently dont encounter them much  and the rural doctors\\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure  i\\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\\nwould make a lot of money\\n \\ngary h merrill  principal systems developer c compiler development\\nsas institute inc  sas campus dr  cary nc  27513  919

the things said by jesus\\nto the pharisees ye hypocrites    ye preach about me with your lips\\nbut your hearts are far removed from me\\n\\n also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\\n and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon\\n belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\\n have been addressed in order to reply to the

any consideration\\nwhatsoever\\n\\n\\n the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus\\n is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds\\n belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same\\n\\na beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation\\nof lds doctrine  the former kgb would have loved to employ you\\njesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it\\n\\n\\n\\n the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is\\n nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible\\n says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god\\n\\ncorrection it may contradict would you think the bible says  the bible\\nindeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that they\\nbelong to or follow god in his footsteps  satan and his followers have\\nrebelled against god and are not children followersredeemed of god\\nbut it doesnt mean that they were not once created

but the tares are the children of the wicked one\\n        matthew 1338\\n\\nso  this illustrates nicely what i just said the children of the\\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus\\nand have shown works of repentance etc and the children of the\\nwicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb  the issue\\nof satans spiritoffspring and those who followed him has not been\\naddressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible  you\\npurposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non\\nrelated scriptures\\n\\nlots of nice scriptures deleted not robert w copyrighted though\\n\\nra  we are told that and this is life eternal that they might know\\nra  thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent\\nra  john 173 life eternal is to know the only true god yet the\\nra  doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly\\nra  different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of\\nra  the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim\\n\\ncorrection my jesus is indeed different than your jesus and can be\\nreconciled with the jesus in the bible  not your interpretation of him\\ni concur but i honestly couldnt care less\\n\\nra  one as being true denies the other from being true according to the\\nra  bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only

news\\ngroup  first get your ldsfacts straight before you dare preaching to us\\nabout the only true god whom you interpret according to your own likes\\nand dislikes but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about\\nhim myself  i guess your grandiose selfimage does not allow for other\\nfaiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different\\nway or fashion than your own  not that it really matters the mission\\nand progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob\\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited\\nevery continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear\\n\\n  this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but\\n  rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to

for reproductive endocrinology and infertility \\n\\n     in vitro fertilization  embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our \\nassisted reproduction program  this procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days before they are transferred \\nto the patients uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer\\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page 25\\nvolume  6 number 10                                           april 20 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform ivfet or indeed gift follicular development is typically \\nstimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse andor gnrh analogues lupron depo \\nlupron synarel occasionally however ivfet is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in nonstimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasoundguided retrieval in our \\ninfertility unit with the patient sedated  \\n     couples who resort to ivfet exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis andor mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility  according to the united states ivf registry the overall \\nsuccess rate for ivfet nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle results from our program involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nivfet cycles reflect a comparable success rate \\n     nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies  well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivfet cycle \\nattempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nassisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies \\n     the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that 1 the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age 2 fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years \\nand 3 provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our \\ncenter therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy \\n\\n     gift  this hightech art procedure is performed in the operating room \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivfet involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian \\ntube an average of 3 eggstube under these circumstances fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page 26\\nvolume  6 number 10                                           april 20 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility \\nandor idiopathic infertility    \\n     the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained \\nwith the ivfet technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for ivfet 14 to 18 percent in view of this fact one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with gift than ivfet however in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the \\npatient these concerns are 1 the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room 2 the risks albeit minimal of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia and 3 the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos \\n     the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the ivfet procedure between \\njanuary 1 1991 and december 31 1992 we have performed a total of 12 gift \\ncycles with an overall success rate of 20 percent \\n     embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual gift eggs or from nontransferred ivf embryos \\nthis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated \\nby the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys \\n     gamete micromanipulation  this art procedure which is still very new \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility less than 10 million spermml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm andor less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the \\nprocedure of subzonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion \\n     available data from szi programs worldwide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm \\ntherefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception \\n\\ncatherine racowsky phd\\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page 27\\nvolume  6 number 10

money  right now i have an 89 accord a good car but not real sporty \\n i was thinking of selling it in about two years and dropping around\\n 20k on a sports car of some kind  after thinking about it i may have a\\n better idea  ill keep the accord until it drops and buy the car ive\\n always wanted  a corvette stingray my reasoning is that 8000 accord\\n 8000 corvette 16000 is less than what i would spend anyway\\n \\n basically im thinking of a late 70s early 80s for around 710k\\n my question is what are good years to consider for reliability looks\\n horsepower  in that order believe it or not horsepower is not a main\\n concern if i want to go fast i get on my motorcycle and what are\\n good prices\\n \\n also what would insurance look like  im male single 23 i might\\n wait until im 25 to get the car  lower insurance would the fact that\\n i mainly drive the other car lower it  is there some type of classic\\n car or rarely driven insurance class for driving it under 10k miles\\n per year\\n \\n     my dad has a 66 vette and its on what you say classic insurance\\n     basically what that means is that it has restricted amount of driving\\n     time which basically means it cant be used as an every day car and would\\n     probably suit your needs for limited mileage\\n  \\n\\n        in my area denver if you look around alittle you can get an\\n    1984 for 10000 or less not much less you said your not looking\\n    to go fast they are a really nice car just not real powerful\\nin addition to restricted mileage many classic insurance carriers also

what value to follow but theres no actual independent\\nspiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\\nsome unique sense right  this sort of model  with modifications of\\none

boosters srbs are responsible\\n    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources the\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study charles jackman\\n\\n    the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was\\n    organized by dr michael prather nasagoddard institute for space\\n    studies  the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia\\n    nasagiss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasagoddard space\\n    flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and\\n    environmental research inc  the effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere\\n\\n    the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine\\n\\n       industrial sources    300000000 kilogramsyear\\n\\t  natural sources     75000000 kilogramsyear\\n\\t  shuttle sources\\t  725000 kilogramsyear\\n\\n    the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly thus the launches would add less than 025 to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources\\n\\n    the effect on ozone is minimal  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 00065 this is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares\\n\\n    the influence of humanmade chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 the influence of the space shuttle and\\n    titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible  the launch\\n    schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time\\n\\n    theoretical results of this study have been published in _the space\\n    shuttles impact on

died\\n\\n    the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is\\n    a welldocumented fact see the rogers commission report for example\\n    what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin\\n    teams medicalforensic report\\n\\n    the astronauts were killed when the moreorless intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200mph and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team\\n    examined them they were sent off to be buried\\n\\n\\n    using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit\\n\\n    you cant use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit\\n    because it cant get there it is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks\\n\\n    furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between earths surface and low orbit taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized highorbit\\n    spacecraft\\n\\n    yet another concise answer by henry spencer\\n\\n\\n    the face on mars\\n\\n    there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a

and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental other viking images show a\\n    smileyfaced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere\\n    on mars there exists a mars anomalies research society sorry dont\\n    know the address to study the face\\n\\n    the mars observer mission will carry

effects  if my experiences say that there exists no god\\nand yours says there does where does that leave us  since we are only\\ngoing on experiences then both of us are correct within our own personal\\nrealities\\n\\nfurthermore the trouble with feelings and experiences is that they\\ncan lead you astray as the tragic outcome of waco illustrates  i\\nam sure that many of koreshs followers really believed in him but\\ni think that you and i will agree that they were being misled\\n\\nfinally how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\\nsphere is not selfexplanatory when you only rely on the five senses\\n\\n christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence \\n which they call faith and which is a gift of god that is this evidence\\n is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself the \\n evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists reasoning\\n on the evidence of the senses wont help either but christians do reason\\n of the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence is wholly\\n consistent with the evidence of the other senses and indeed that the\\n evidence of these other senses is part of gods revelation of himself\\n to us\\n\\nyou must be using a definition of evidence that i am not familiar with\\nto me evidence is something you can show others unambiguously that\\nwhat you are saying is true\\n\\nhowever i agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith\\nit is not something you can share around  others must experience it\\nindependantly  unfortunately as i have explained above this puts\\nbelief down to a matter of experience  my impression is that christians\\ndo not have the monopoly on reason evidence and faith as far as any of\\nthese things can go\\n\\n in a previous article phs431dvaxcccmonasheduau  says\\n \\nyou are right that science and reason cannot prove anything  however if\\nwe do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone  and since\\nwe can only use faith why is one picture of god eg hinduism any less\\nvalid than another eg christianity\\n\\n faith as i have said is not opposed to reason it is simply a new source \\n of evidence on which reason may operate it is clear that human beings\\n have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses and\\n similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\\n faith religious believers in general and christians in particular use\\n reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\\n of the evidence provided by faith science claims with good reason to be\\n the most valid system for explaining the physical universe and christianity\\n claims also with good reason to be the most valid system possessed of the\\n best evidence for explaining gods revelations of himself to man\\n\\nat the risk of repeating my argument  as i have explained previously \\nthe trouble is that moslems buddhists jews etc will all say that they\\nclaim with good reason to be a valid system possessed of the best\\nevidence for explaining gods revelations to man for buddhists it\\nshould read for explaining the nonexistence of god  so not only\\nmust you prove your own case you have to disprove theirs\\n\\naltmessianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief\\nof their own faiths  and with their own good reasons\\n\\n if you doubt that christians use reason read this newsgroup for a while\\n and you will see rational debate aplenty\\n\\ni know that all people can use reason  i never claimed that they

options\\n\\n   in order to install the rodime ro 3000a series drives the dumpers for \\nthe singledual drive and led operation on the drive need to be set as \\ndescribed in the relevant product specification\\n   i a single drive environment the drive is described as a master\\n   in a dual drive environment the drives are described as a master and a\\nslave this is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \\nwhen performing diagnostics\\n   there are four links lk1 lk2 lk4 and lk5 adjacent to the 40 way \\ninterface connector they have the following functions and are described \\nin order as viewed from the end of the drive with the first jumper \\ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector\\n\\nlk2 led \\n     when fitted this jumper connects the led drive to pin 39 of the\\n     interface this allows a led to be connected to the interface an\\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\\n     the led when this option is selected the value of the resistor will\\n     be dependant on the led type chosen but will be in the range of 130\\n     ohms ot 220 ohms\\n\\nlk1 dual drives\\n     this jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\\n     bus it fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector\\n     indicating to the master drive the presence of a slave\\n\\nlk4 master\\n     when fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a master if\\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\\n     jumpered in this way\\n\\nlk5 iochrdy\\n     when fitted this connects the iochrdy signal to the drive it is \\n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\\n     data transfer rate than the drive ie greater than 4 mbytes per\\n     second when using 11 interleave this jumper is not normally \\n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 mbytes per\\n     second\\n\\n   there are four possible masterslave configurations in which a drives\\nmay be jumpered\\n\\n     master single drive with led on interface\\t\\tlk2  lk4 fitted\\n     master single drive without led on interface\\tlk4 only fitted\\n

fitted\\n     slave dual drive with led on interface\\t\\tlk2 only fitted\\n\\n   the master drive will delay powerup for approximately two seconds to\\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used\\n\\n   the other connections for a led will be found close to the 28 way \\nconnector at the other end of the drive this led driver is not affected\\nby the link options an internal

do the contents of two\\nteabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves\\n\\non top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum baskettype steamer with\\ntwo chicken breasts in it  the lid was put on and the whole assembly\\nwent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes\\n\\nlater he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts  what surprises\\nand concerns me are\\n\\n1  no wood chips  where does the smoke flavor come from\\n\\n2  about 5 or 10 years ago i remember hearing that carmel color\\n    obtained by caramelizing sugar  a common coloring and flavoring\\n    agent had been found to be carcinogenic  i believe they injected\\n    it under the skin of rats or something  if the results were conclusive\\n    caramel color would not be legal in the us yet it is still being\\n    used  was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what\\n\\n3  about 5 or 10 years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated\\n    as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract\\n    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit  does anyone know whatever\\n    happened with that story  if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea\\n    could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do\\n    so\\n\\nwrt natural wood smoke ive smoking a duck right now as it happens\\nive noticed that a heavilysmoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy\\ntaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently\\nstopped flowing  i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips\\ngetting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process\\nthen slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips\\n\\nmy theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are lowmolecular weight\\nstuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort\\nof larger molecule more similar to tar  the long barbeque time after\\nthe initial intensive smoke drives off the lowmolecular weight stuff\\njust leaving the flavor behind  does anyone know if my theory is correct\\n\\ni also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping\\non the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic  for that reason and because\\nit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grill\\nnondrippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals  i do stuff like this\\nduck by indirect heat  i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coals\\nat one end and the meat at the other end  the fat drops directly on the\\nfloor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire\\nin that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals\\n\\nand yet another reason ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that\\nsmoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains\\nnitrosamines which are carcinogenic  im pretty sure this claim actually\\nhas some standing dont know about the others\\n\\nan amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it was\\ndiscovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting\\na lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils\\nthis is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic\\nthe guy who represented the company in the press conference defended\\nhimself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day\\nfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two

that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs  thus the top youth leaders of its\\nteams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal

pittsburgh if they\\nface them in the finals which is what all the detroit sportswriters \\nare predicting  although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm\\ni have ever seen in hockey\\n\\nhow do you figure that  when bryan murray took over the wings they were\\na pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked\\nunlikely to win it  now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\\nthe stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it  a truly great gm would\\nhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\\nof the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup  a good gm like murray can\\nmaintain the teams success but cant push them to the next level\\n\\nwhen jacques demers brought the wings to the conference finals twice a\\nfew years back he had everyone on the team giving 100 percent but he \\nhad very little talent  he had yzerman bob probert who had drinking\\nproblems at the time and a couple of decent goaltenders in hanlon and\\nstefan who got hot  thats about it  can you name one player on those\\nearlier teams who even deserved to be in the allstar game much less \\nactually got there other than yzerman and probert  like petr klima\\ngive me a break  when they faced edmonton in both of those conference\\nfinals as hard as they played it was clear they faced a team that simply\\nhad superior talent to the wings  thats why they could not get to the\\nfinals  also at that time the norris division was still the weakest \\ndivision in hockey and getting past chicago and toronto was not as\\nimpressive as it is today\\n\\nmurray has brought scoring talent to the wings that they did not have a\\nfew years ago when devellano was gm and demers was coach  to name a few\\nysebaert kozlov and paul coffey who has made a definite positive impact on\\nthe power play especially  \\n\\nmurray has built one of the most talented teams in hockey at the present with\\nthe possible exception of the pittsburgh penguins  the wings have at least\\nfive 30 goal scorers that i can think of and a couple of defenseman with over\\n100 games worth of playoff experience  murrays one failing is that unlike\\nthe other gms you mentioned who are definitely also good dont get me\\nwrong he has not found for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to\\ngo out and give 100 percent for the full 60 minutes every night like they \\ndid the last time they made a cup run  when a team wins or loses its a\\nreflection of the gm and the coach which was the point of my original \\npost  if the team outmatches their opponent in terms of talent but loses\\nanyway which has been the case this year when the wings have struggled\\nthat indicates that the gm has done his job in building up the team but the\\ncoach has failed to motivate them  if as in the case of the last run the\\nwings made in the playoffs before murray came they gave opponents a hard\\ntime who should have beaten them easily that indicates good coaching making\\nup for a lack of talent\\n\\nall of this is fine  i never said that murray was a bad gm  i merely said\\nthat he isnt the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor\\nif murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup\\nby now probably more than once  if he was as great a gm as you claim\\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent\\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success\\nbut murray is an average unspectacular nhl coach and a pretty good gm\\nso none of this is true

is\\nnot terrorism  that having been said lets continue\\n\\n   snip\\n   imagine   it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like \\n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc\\n\\ni would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist\\ncamps  there are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion \\n\\n   some young men usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the lebanese resistance  even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to  these young men are\\n   supported financially by iran most of the time  they sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for israeli patrols  every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians  once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist  hideout where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be\\n\\nsome of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you\\ndescribe  not all are  there are a large number of groups in the area\\nbacked by various organizations with a wide range of purposes  hizbollah\\nand amal were two of the larger ones and may still be  as to retaliation\\nwhile mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing which would have produced major casualties\\n\\n   israels retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying \\n   israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw\\n\\nwell here we disagree  i think that israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe lebanese govt was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks\\n\\n   this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed  in fact it has caused much more\\n   israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel\\n   would have resulted in  \\n\\nactually that is not clear at all  i will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though\\n\\n   there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such \\n   circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of lebanon\\n\\nno the syrian govt is more than happy to have israel sink into another\\nlebanese morass  i could elaborate if necessary\\n\\n   i agree only in the case of the isareli
